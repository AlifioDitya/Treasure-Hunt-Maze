## Opening Monologue
早上好中国  
现在我有冰淇淋  
我很喜欢冰淇淋  
但是 《速度与激情9》  
比冰淇淋  
速度与激情—《速度与激情9》  
我最喜欢  
所以... 现在是音乐时间  
准备 不要忘记 不要错过  
记得去电影院看《速度与激情9》  
因为非常好电影  
动作非常好  
差不多一样冰淇淋  
再见  

## Description
This repository contains a project for an Algorithm Strategies Course Project, which focuses on the implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms for solving a treasure hunt maze searching problem.

## Getting Started
To use this program, you need to have the following installed on your system:
1. C# Programming Language
2. .NET Framework
3. Visual Studio 2022
4. .NET MAUI

## How to Run
To run the program, follow these steps:
1. Install the prerequisites
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine
3. Open the solution file `BingChilling.sln` located in the `src` folder with Visual Studio
4. Select `BingChillingGUI` as the target project
5. Select an emulator and click the play button on the top navigation bar as shown below

## Usage
To use the program, you will need to load the maze text file from a selected source. Make sure it is in a correct format specified on the document in the `doc` folder.

To run the program, select an algorithm (BFS or DFS) and select on whether or not the solution contains the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) bonus that traverses the nodes back to the starting point after all treasures have been found by ticking the boxes. Click `visualize` to show the paths taken and a slider is available to speed up the animation process. To reset the searching process, you can click the `reset` button.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
1. `src` folder contains the C# source code files.
2. `test` folder contains the test cases for the program
3. `doc` folder contains the report document for this project

## Implementation Details
The program uses two algorithms, BFS and DFS, to solve a treasure hunt maze searching problem. The program reads a maze data file and represents the maze as a graph. Then, it applies BFS or DFS to search for the treasure location in the maze.

The program outputs the shortest path to the treasure location, the total number of nodes explored, and the time taken by the algorithm to find the treasure.
